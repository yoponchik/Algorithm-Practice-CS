1. Create a class

--------------------------------------------------------
2. Create a method. Think what is the output and the input.

The input is iteration n, which can be INT type.
The output is a whole number, but can be long: so LONG type

remember the methods have to be static. 
----------------------------------------------------

3. First, BruteForce it. In the FIB method

a. Determine the base case
	-if n=1,2, then output is 1
	-therefore, if (n <= 2), return 1;
 
b. Determine what the output is in relation to the iteration n. (Have to work backwards)
	-The output of the nth iteration is the sum of the one before that (n-1) and the one before that one (n-2)
	-We can call it recursively: Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2);
c. Return it
	-Return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2);

d. Check in Main function (remember this is static too)
	-Console.WriteLine(Fib(n));

--------------------------------------------------------

4. Memoize it

a. Declare a Dictionary
	-Determine what the keys are going to be
	-keys are generally step/number/word that is repeated; in this case, n
	-Dictionaries have two types to be declared: the key type and the value type
	-Since we want the Fib output (LONG type value) using n (INT type key), declare a STATIC dictionary
		-static Dictionary<int, long> _memo = new Dictionary<int, long>(); 

	-Remember STATIC, KEY and VALUE type, and () in the end!!

b. 2 places to implement the memo. (1) the return (2) the storing
	-Add a base case to return the memo values
		- if(_memo.ContainsKey(n)) {return _memo[n];}
	-Store the original output as another variable
		-var value = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2);
	-Store into memo
		-_memo[n] = value;
	-Return the output that is not memoized
------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTES

-STATIC
	-methods
	-Dictionary
-Notation
	-Dictionary - () in the end
	-ContainsKey()
	-memo[n] - memo is sort of like an array, it has an index
-Memo
	-return it
	-store it

-Question Type
	-Sequential: Therfore only positive base case.
